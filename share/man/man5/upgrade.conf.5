.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm upgrade.conf
.Nd upgrade configuration
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /etc/upgrade.conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm upgrade.conf
controls the actions taken by
.Xr sysupgrade 8
during a system upgrade as described in
.Xr upgrade 7 .
The file allows customizing whether the new source code is installed and what
happens to the old source code.
It also records information about the system such as how the system is booted.
The file is created automatically by
.Xr sysinstall 8
as part of
.Xr installation 7
to match what was installed.
.Pp
Developers may wish to customize what happens to
.Pa /src
on a system upgrade.
The new source code can be installed or not.
If it is installed, it can be installed in
.Pa /newsrc
or by default in
.Pa /src .
Any existing source code will be safely moved inside a subdirectory of
.Pa /oldsrc .
.Sh FORMAT
The file is read line by line.
The # character starts a comment and the rest of the line is ignored.
Lines are supposed to contain assignments to variables.
An assignment is the name of the variable, whitespace, an equal character,
whitespace, the value, whitespace, and then the end of the line.

.It Sy grub Ns "=" Ns Oo Sy no "|" yes Oc (default Sy no )
States GRUB is used as the bootloader.
If so, then the bootloader is reinstalled
.Xr ( grub-install 8 )
and updated
.Xr ( update-grub 8 ) .
.It Sy newsrc Ns "=" Ns Oo Sy no "|" yes Oc (default Sy no )
Place the new source code in
.Pa /newsrc
and move any existing
.Pa /newsrc
into
.Pa /oldsrc .
This preserves the current
.Pa /src
directory.
This takes precedence over and disables the behavior described under
.Sy src .
.It Sy src Ns "=" Ns Oo Sy no "|" yes Oc (default Sy no )
Place the new source code in
.Pa /src
and move any existing
.Pa /src
into
.Pa /oldsrc .
.El
.Pp
The defaults will be used if
.Pa /etc/upgrade.conf
is missing.
