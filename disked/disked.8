.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm disked
.Op Fl in
.Op Fl \-fstab Ns "=" Ns Ar path
.Op Ar device
.Op Ar command ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is an interactive program that manages partition tables.
It can create and destroy partition tables on block devices.
It can create partitions and destroy them.
It can format filesystems on partitions and configure mountpoints in
.Xr fstab 5 .
.Nm
supports the Master Boot Record and GUID Partition Table partitioning schemes.
.Pp
.Nm
provides an interactive command line.
Its prompt shows the currently selected
.Ar device
(defaulting to the first writable device alphabetically if any) or
.Li (disked)
if none is selected.
If a
.Ar command
is specified on the command line, then that command is run with its arguments
non-interactively instead of reading from the standard input.
.Pp
Commands perform their actions when run rather than waiting for the user to
write out changes.
.Nm
only creates partitions aligned to 1 MiB boundaries whose size is a multiple of
1 MiB.
Unused regions are aligned and those smaller than the alignment are not shown.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Fl \-fstab Ns "=" Ns Ar path
Use
.Ar path
instead of
.Pa /etc/fstab
as
.Xr fstab 5 .
.It Fl i
Run in interactive mode with prompt with line editing.
Commands will ask for missing parameters.
This is the default if the standard input and output are terminals and a
.Ar command
is not specified on the command line.
.It Fl n
Run in non-interactive mode reading commands from the standard input.
Commands will not ask for missing parameters and
.Nm
will immediately exit unsuccessfully if any command fail.
.El
.Pp
The following commands are supported:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Sy device Ar device-index
Switch to the device
.Ar device-index
as numbered by the
.Sy devices
command.
If no index is specified, show the name of the current device.
Alternatively you can write the absolute path to the device such as
.Pa /dev/ahci0
or just its name
.Pa ahci0 .
.It Sy devices
List every available block device and show their indexes, device names (as found
in
.Pa /dev ) ,
model names and serial numbers.
Devices are counted from 0.
.It Sy exit
Exit
.Nm .
.It Sy fsck Ar partition-index
Perform a
.Xr fsck 8
filesystem check of the partition
.Ar partition-index
on the current device.
.It Sy help
List available commands.
.It Sy id Ar partition-index
List the identifiers for the filesystem on the partition
.Ar partition-index
on the current device.
These identifiers are key-values separated by an equals character, suitable for
use in the
.Xr fstab 5
.Fa fs_spec
field to locate filesystems.
.It Sy ls
Display the partition table of the current device.
Partitions are counted from 1.
.It Sy man Oo ... Oc
Display this manual page if no operands are given, otherwise run
.Xr man 1
with the given command line.
.It Sy mkpart Ar hole Ar offset Ar length Ar filesystem Ar mountpoint Ar options
Create a partition on the current device.
If the partition table has multiple unused regions
.Pq holes ,
.Nm
asks you which
.Ar hole
(counting from 1) to use.
You need to specify the
.Ar offset
into the hole where the partition is created and
then the
.Ar length of the partition.
See
.Sx QUANTITIES
below on the possible partition offset and length values.
You will be asked if you want to format a filesystem:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Sy biosdata
(gpt only) Format a BIOS boot partition, which is required for booting with GRUB
from a root filesystem on a GPT partition.
1 MiB is sufficient for this kind of partition.
.It Sy extended
(mbr only) Create an extended partition, which can contain an arbitrary amount
logical partitions.
You can only have a single extended partition.
.It Sy ext2
Format an ext2 filesystem.
.It Sy no
Use the existing disk data.
.El
.Pp
If you format a mountable filesystem, then you will be asked if you want to
create a
.Ar mountpoint
for the partition, which will be added to
.Xr fstab 5 .
If a mountpoint is created, then you will be asked for the comma-separated mount
options for the filesystem, which are typically
.Sy rw
for read-write access,
.Sy ro
for read-only access,
.Sy cache Ns = Ns Ar N Ns %
to set the cache size to N percent of system memory, or other filesystem
specific values.
.It Sy mktable Oo mbr "|" gpt Oc
Create a partition table on the current device of the specified type.
.It Sy mount Ar partition-index Oo Ar mountpoint Li "|" Sy no Oc Ar options
Mount the partition
.Ar partition-index
of the current device on
.Ar mountpoint
with the mount
.Ar options
in
.Xr fstab 5 ,
or if
.Sy no
then remove any existing mountpoints.
Conflicting mountpoints are removed.
.It Sy quit
Exit
.Nm .
.It Sy rmpart Ar partition-index
Delete the partition
.Ar partition-index
on the current device.
The partition data is rendered inaccessible but is not actually erased.
The partition can technically be recovered using
.Sy mkpart .
The partition data no longer has the protections of being in a partition and
looks like regular unused space and can easily be overwritten.
You should not delete a partition unless you want its contents gone.
Deleting an extended partition deletes all the partitions it contains.
.It Sy rmtable
Delete the partition table on the current device.
The existing partitions are rendered inaccessible but are not actually erased.
The partitions can technically be recovered using
.Sy mktable
and
.Sy mkpart .
The disk data no longer has the protections of being partitioned and looks like
regular unused space and can easily be overwritten.
You should not delete the partition table unless you want all the data on the
disk gone.
.It Sy sh
Run an interactive shell.
.El
.Sh QUANTITIES
.Nm
allows useful expressions when describing disk offsets and lengths.
Every question needs an answer between 0 and a maximum.
You can answer in percent where 100% is the maximum.
You can answer an integer value followed by a suffix such as B, K, M, G, T, or P
to signify bytes, KiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, and PiB respectively.
The value is in MiB by default if there is no suffix.
The answer is rounded to the 1 MiB alignment.
If the expression is a negative value, then the answer is the maximum minus the
absolute value.
For instance:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It 42%
Use 42% of the maximum.
.It 13m
Use 13 MiB.
.It 37
Use 37 MiB.
.It 9001 GiB
Use 9001 GiB.
.It -100M
Leave 100 MiB at the end.
.It -10%
Use 90% of the maximum.
