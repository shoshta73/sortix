.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates additional bootloader configuration for Sortix .iso releases that can
be overlaid onto the release .iso's filesystem, for instance by using a tool
such as
.Xr tix-iso-add 8 .
.Pp
.Nm
creates the
.Ar output-directory
directory if it doesn't already exist and populates it with the requested
additional configuration.
By default, the only action it takes is to creates a skeleton
.Pa output-directory/boot/grub/hooks.cfg
that appends " - modified by
.Ar username Ns @ Ns Ar hostname Ns
"
to the
.Sy base_menu_title
variable, which changes the boot menu title to say the .iso was modified by the
current username on the local hostname.
.Pp
This script is designed to be convenient when modifying a Sortix release .iso as
part of the
.Xr release-iso-modification 7
procedure.
Additional bootloader configuration can be provided as described in
.Xr release-iso-bootconfig 7 .
The user is free to take all its actions themselves if it doesn't meet their
needs, or to make changes to the output after running the script.
These configuration changes apply only to the live environment, not to any
installations made from inside it.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "12345678"
.It Fl \-append-title Ns = Ns Ar text
Append " - " followed by
.Ar text
to the bootloader menu title by appending to the
.Sy base_menu_title
GRUB variable.
If this option is not set, the default value is " - modified by
.Ar username Ns @ Ns Ar hostname Ns
", where
.Ar username
is the output of running
.Li id -un
and
.Ar hostname
is the output of running
.Li hostname .
The bootloader menu title is appended to by default, but can be disabled with
.Fl \-disable-append-title ,
and re-enabled with
.Fl \-enable-append-title ,
whichever comes last takes precedence.
.It Fl \-console Ns = Ns Ar terminal
Forward the
.Fl \-console
option to the
.Xr kernel 7
to select the
.Ar terminal
to use as the console and the settings to initialize it.
.Pp
The
.Ev TERM
variable can be overridden by suffixing the quoted argument with a space
followed by
.Fl \-term Ns = Ns Ar terminal .
.It Fl \-default Ns = Ns Ar default-boot-menu-option
Select bootloader menu option number
.Ar default-boot-menu-option
by default (counting from 0).
If the selected menu option itself is a submenu,
.Ar default-boot-menu-option
can be appended with a
.Sy '>'
and another selection to pick a default menu option in that submenu, and so on.
This option sets the
.Sy default
GRUB variable.
.It Fl \-disable-append-title
Don't append anything to the bootloader menu title by appending to the
.Sy base_menu_title
GRUB variable.
.It Fl \-disable-dhclient
Disable automatic DHCP configuration by setting the
.Sy enable_dhclient
GRUB variable to
.Sy false ,
causing the bootloader to load additional configuration that turns off the
.Xr dhclient 8
daemon on boot.
.It Fl \-disable-gui
Disable the GUI by setting the
.Sy enable_gui
GRUB variable to
.Sy false ,
which makes the bootloader configuration not append
.Sy -gui
to the requested
.Xr init 8
target.
.It Fl \-disable-network-drivers
Disable network drivers by setting the
.Sy enable_network_drivers
GRUB variable to the
.Fl \-disable-network-drivers
option which will be passed on the
.Xr kernel 7
command line.
.It Fl \-disable-ntpd
Disable automatically starting the ntp client by setting the
.Sy enable_ntpd
GRUB variable to
.Sy false ,
selecting the default behavior of not starting the
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon.
.It Fl \-disable-src
Disable loading the source code in
.Pa /src
by setting
.Sy enable_src
GRUB variable to
.Sy false .
.It Fl \-disable-sshd
Disable automatically starting the ssh server by setting the
.Sy enable_sshd
GRUB variable to
.Sy false ,
selecting the default behavior of not starting the
.Xr sshd 8
daemon.
.It Fl \-enable-append-title
Enable appending " - " followed by the value set with
.Fl \-append-title
to the bootloader menu title by appending to the
.Sy base_menu_title
GRUB variable.
This option is on by default and can be disabled with
.Fl \-disable-append-title .
.It Fl \-enable-dhclient
Enable automatic DHCP configuration by setting the
.Sy enable_dhclient
GRUB variable to
.Sy true ,
selecting the default behavior of starting the
.Xr dhclient 8
daemon.
.It Fl \-enable-gui
Enable the GUI by setting the
.Sy enable_gui
GRUB variable to
.Sy true ,
which makes the bootloader configuration append
.Sy -gui
to the requested
.Xr init 8
target.
.It Fl \-enable-network-drivers
Enable network drivers by setting the
.Sy enable_network_drivers
GRUB variable to the
.Fl \-enable-network-drivers
option which will be passed on the
.Xr kernel 7
command line.
.It Fl \-enable-ntpd
Enable automatically starting the ntp client by setting the
.Sy enable_ntpd
GRUB variable to
.Sy true ,
causing the bootloader to load additional configuration that turns on the
.Xr ntpd 8
daemon on boot.
.It Fl \-enable-src
Enable loading the source code in
.Pa /src
by setting
.Sy enable_src
GRUB variable to
.Sy true .
.It Fl \-enable-sshd
Enable automatically starting the ssh server by setting the
.Sy enable_sshd
GRUB variable to
.Sy true ,
causing the bootloader to load additional configuration that turns on the
.Xr sshd 8
daemon on boot.
.It Fl \-grub-serial Ns = Ns Ar terminal
Use the serial
.Ar terminal
for GRUB's menu in the format of the
.Xr kernel 7
.Fl \-console
option.
.It Fl \-kernel-options Ns = Ns Ar options
Forward these additional
.Ar options
to the
.Xr kernel 7 .
.It Fl \-init-target Ns = Ns Ar target
Add a new first menu entry that boots the
.Ar target
daemon as the
.Xr init 8
target.
.It Fl \-liveconfig Ns = Ns Ar liveconfig-directory
Overlay the
.Ar liveconfig-directory
directory onto the live environment, allowing full customization of the
live environment.
The
.Xr tix-iso-liveconfig 8
script is convenient for making the
.Ar liveconfig-directory
directory.
This option makes a
.Xr tar 1
archive compressed with
.Xr xz 1
of the
.Ar liveconfig-directory
directory and places it at
.Pa output-directory/boot/liveconfig.tar.xz .
Regardless of this option, if a
.Pa output-directory/boot/liveconfig.tar.xz
is found, the
.Sy xzio
GRUB module is loaded and an
.Sy hook_initrd_post
hook is emitted that loads
.Pa output-directory/boot/liveconfig.tar.xz
as a multiboot module.
.Pp
If the liveconfig contains
.Xr autoinstall.conf 5
or
.Xr autoupgrade.conf 5 ,
the menu titles are modified to loudly warn they will automatically
install/upgrade the operating system.
.It Fl \-ps2-scancode-set Ns = Ns Ar set
Force a PS/2 keyboard scancode set by setting the
.Sy ps2_scancode_set
GRUB variable to the
.Fl \-ps2-scancode-set=set
option which will be passed on the
.Xr kernel 7
command line.
.It Fl \-random-seed
Copy 256 bytes of randomness from
.Pa /dev/urandom
to
.Pa output-directory/boot/random.seed ,
which the existing bootloader configuration will automatically detect and use
to seed the kernel's random number generation.
This option is recommended (but notice the warnings below) as the official
releases do not come with any entropy, as entropy must be secret and only known
to a single installation.
.Pp
Warning: The information in the generated
.Pa output-directory/boot/random.seed
file must be kept confidential and should be securely erased wherever it goes
whenever it is no longer useful in a particular place, otherwise the random
number generation of the system using this entropy might be vulnerable.
This random seed must not be recycled to boot more than a single system once.
Additional systems and boots should be done with different entropy by modifying
the release again.
An installation live environment booted with such a random seed will use it to
randomly generate secure initial random seeds for each installation made, and
each such installation will take care not to reuse the random seed across boots.
Once the
.Ar output-directory
is no longer useful, the
.Pa output-directory/boot/random.seed
path inside it should be securely erased.
If a release .iso has been made from
.Ar output-directory ,
it should be securely erased when no longer useful.
If a release .iso has been burned to a physical media, it should be securely
erased when no longer useful.
.It Fl \-serial Ns = Ns Ar terminal
Boot entirely using the serial
.Ar terminal
as specified in the format of the
.Xr kernel 7
.Fl \-console
option.
This option is a shorthand equivalent to setting the
.Fl \-console ,
.Fl \-grub-console ,
.Fl \-serial-console ,
and
.Fl \-disable-gui
options.
.It Fl \-serial-console Ns = Ns Ar terminal
Whenever the serial console is enabled in the advanced bootloader menu, forward
this
.Fl \-console
option to the
.Xr kernel 7
to select the
.Ar terminal 1
to use as the console and the settings to initialize it.
.Pp
The
.Ev TERM
variable can be overridden by suffixing the quoted argument with a space
followed by
.Fl \-term Ns = Ns Ar terminal .
.It Fl \-timeout Ns = Ns Ar boot-menu-timeout
Pick the default bootloader menu option after
.Ar boot-menu-timeout
seconds.
If
.Ar boot-menu-timeout
is 0, pick the default menu option immediately.
If
.Ar boot-menu-timeout
is -1, the timeout is disabled.
This option sets the
.Sy timeout
GRUB variable.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
will exit 0 on success and non-zero otherwise.
.Sh EXAMPLES
This section contains examples of how one can modify a release .iso.
.Ss "No Change"
